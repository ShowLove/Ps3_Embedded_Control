I made the test input file, and a test output file.

Input File called: "control.in"
Output File called: "control.out"

First line of the input file is the format of the line
Second line of the input file is how many items are below it

INPUT EXAMPLE:

Hello my name is %, and I like to partY
2
Daniel
Carlos


OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
Hello my name is Daniel, and I like to party
Hello my name is Carlos, and I like to party

Bottom line: make a program that reads an input file and gets the output file like shown
